    <span style="font-size: 14px">We present a novel numerical platform for the large-scale simulation of fibrous structures immersed in a Stokesian fluid and evolving within a confinement or in free-space. One of the main motivations for this work is the application of this platform to study the dynamics of cellular assemblies. For this, we also incorporate the key biophysical elements that determine the dynamics of these assemblies, which includes the polymerization and depolymerization kinetics of fibers, their interactions with molecular motors and other objects, their flexibility, and strong hydrodynamic coupling.
This work, to our knowledge, is the first technique to include many-body hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) and the resulting fluid flows in the cellular assemblies within a cell. We use the non-local slender body theory to compute the fluid-structure interactions of the fibers and a second-kind boundary integral formulation for other rigid bodies and the outer boundary. A kernel-independent implementation of fast multiple method is utilized for efficient evaluation of HIs. The deformation of the fibers is described by the nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and their polymerization is modeled by the reparametrization of the dynamic equations in the appropriate non-Lagrangian frame. We use a pseudo-spectral representation and implicit HIs in the time-stepping to resolve large deformations of the fibers, and to allow time-steps not constrained by temporal stiffness or fiber-fiber interactions. The entire computational scheme is parallelized, which enables simulating assemblies of thousands of fibers. We use our method to investigate two important questions in mechanics of cell division: (i) the effect of confinement on the hydrodynamic mobility of the microtubule asters; and (ii) the dynamics of the positioning of mitotic spindle in complex cellular geometries. Finally to demonstrate the general applicability of the method, we investigate the sedimentation of a cloud of fibers under gravity.

The proper positioning of the mitotic spindle is crucial for asymmetric cell division and generating cell diversity during development. Proper position in the single-cell embryo of Caenorhabditis elegans is achieved initially by the migration and rotation of the pronuclear complex (PNC) and its two associated centrosomal arrays of microtubules (MTs). We present here the first systematic theoretical study of how these O(1000) centrosomal microtubules (MTs) interact through the immersing cytoplasm, the cell periphery and PNC, and with each other, to achieve proper position. This study is made possible through our development of a highly efficient and parallelized computational framework that accounts explicitly for long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) between the MTs, while also capturing their flexibility, dynamic instability, and interactions with molecular motors and boundaries. First, we show through direct simulation that previous estimates of the PNC drag coefficient, based on either ignoring or partially including HIs, lead to misprediction of the active forces and time-scales of migration by an order of magnitude. We then directly study the dynamics of PNC migration under various force-transduction models, including the pushing or pulling of MTs at the cortex, and the pulling of MTs by cytoplasmically- bound force generators. While achieving proper position and orientation on physiologically reasonable time-scales does not uniquely choose a model, we find that each model produces a different signature in its induced cytoplasmic flow and MT conformations. We suggest then that cytoplasmic flows and MT conformations can be used to differentiate between mechanisms and to determine their contribution to the migration process. Since these flow signatures are generic features of each model, they can used to investigate the presence of active processes in other stages of the cell division and other organisms.

		<span style="font-size: 14px">Accelerated Stokesian Dynamics (ASD) discrete particle simulations and microstructural theory are applied to study structure and the viscosity of hard-sphere Brownian dispersions in active microrheology (MR). The work considers moderate to dense suspensions, from near to far from equilibrium conditions. The microscopic theory explicitly considers many-body hydrodynamic interactions in active MR, and is compared with the results of simulations that include detailed near and far field hydrodynamic interactions. Two conditions of moving the probe sphere, which has the same radius a as the bath particles, are considered: these apply constant force (CF) and constant velocity (CV), which model magnetic bead and optical tweezer experiments, respectively. The structure is quantified using the probability distribution of colloidal particles around the probe, Pb|p(r) = ng(r), giving the probability of finding a bath particle centered at a vector position r relative to a moving probe particle instantaneously centered at the origin; n is the bath particle number density, related to the dispersion solid volume fraction, φ, by n = 3φ/4πa3. The pair distribution function for the bath particles relative to the probe, g(r) is computed as a solution to pair Smoluchowski equation (SE) for 0.2 ≤ φ ≤ 0.50, and a range of P ́eclet numbers, describing the ratio of external force on the probe to thermal forces and defined Pef = Fexta/(kbT) and PeU = 6πηU^{ext}a2/(kbT) for CF and CV conditions, respectively. Through ASD simulations and theory we demonstrate that the length of the zone depleted of bath particles behind the moving probe that forms at large P ́eclet numbers, eventually saturates at P ef ≫ 1 for CF while it continuously grows in CV. This contrast in behavior is related to the dispersion in the motion of the probe under CF conditions, while CV motion has no dispersion; we demonstrate that the dispersion is a direct result of many-body hydrodynamic interactions. We incorporate this effect in our theory by a force-induced hydrodynamic diffusion flux in the pair SE. We also demonstrate that, despite of this difference of structure in two methods, the probability distribution of particles near the probe is primarily set by the P ́eclet number, for both CF and CV conditions, in agreement with dilute theories. The consequence of this is similar values for apparent viscosity for both conditions. Finally, using our microscopic theory, we show that the structural anisotropy and Brownian viscosity near equilibrium is quantitatively similar in both CF and CV motions which is in contrast with the dilute theory which predict distortions and Brownian viscosities twice as large in CV vs CF. We show that this difference arises due to of the determining role of many-body interparticle interactions in semi-dilute to concentrated regime. </span>
      <h2><strong> Pair-particle dynamics and microstructure in sheared colloidal suspensions: Simulation and Smoluchowski theory </strong></h2>

        The Smoluchowski equation (SE) approach reduced to pair level provides an accepted method for analysis of the pairmicrostructure, i.e., the pair distribution function g(r), in sheared colloidal suspensions. Under dilute conditions, the resulting problem is well-defined, but for concentrated suspensions the coefficients of the pair SE are unclear. This work outlines a recently developed theoretical approach for analyti- cal and numerical study of the pair SE for concentrated colloidal suspensions of spheres in shear flow, and then focuses upon evaluation of coefficients and related properties of the problem from Stokesian Dynamics simulation, over a wide range of particle volume fraction, φ, and P´
eclet number (ratio of shear to Brownian mo-
tion). The pair distribution function determined from the SE theory is in generally good agreement with Stokesian Dynamics, as are the computed viscosity and normal stresses of the material. The primary focus of the work is to consider the pair relative velocity predicted by the theory in comparison to Stokesian Dynamics simulations, as well as to evaluate quantities related to the hydrodynamic dispersion needed in the theoretical approach. The pair dynamics for moderate particle volume fraction,
0.20 ≤ φ ≤ 0.35, are found to be remarkably different from the form for an isolated pair of spheres, and at φ ≥ 0.40 a qualitative change is again seen. Agreement of the theory and simulation on the primary features of the particle motion and structure is good, and discrepancies are clearly delineated.

 <h2><strong> Effect of repulsive interactions on structure and rheology of sheared colloidal dispersions </strong></h2>

        A previously developed Smoluchowski theory for concentrated hard-sphere suspensions in shear flow is extended to study struc- ture and rheology of colloidal suspensions with soft repulsive interactions. Accelerated Stokesian Dynamics simulations are carried out to provide insight and to enable direct comparison with theoretical predictions. The effect of extended range repulsive interactions is studied by considering repulsive interactions with different steepness, using identical potentials in simulation and
theory, for varying shear rates characterized in dimensionless form as 0.1 ≤ Pe ≤ 100; here, Pe = 6πη ˙γa3/kbT is the ratio of hydrodynamic to Brownian forces and η is the fluid viscosity, ˙γ is the shear rate, a is the particle radius and kbT is the thermal energy. Examples of predicted microstructures and the equivalent simulated results for hard-sphere suspensions at φ =0.40 are also presented for comparison. The predicted pair distribution function is in good agreement with simulations before the onset of a shear-induced ordering transition in simulations of the soft colloids. The calculations of shear viscosity based on the predicted microstructure were also in general agreement with simulation results. The role of hydrodynamic interactions on flow-induced structures is discussed in the context of the proposed theory.

 <h2><strong> Microstructural theory and the rheology ofconcentrated colloidal suspensions </strong></h2>

        A theory for the analytical prediction of microstructure of concentrated Brownian suspensions of spheres in simple-shear flow is developed. The computed microstructure is used in a prediction of the suspension rheology. A near-hard-sphere suspension is studied for solid volume fraction φ < 0.55 and P ́eclet number Pe = 6πηγ ̇a3/kbT < 100; a is the particle radius, η is the suspending Newtonian fluid viscosity, γ ̇ is the shear rate, kb is the Boltzmann constant and T is absolute temperature. The method developed determines the steady pair distribution function g(r), where r is the pair separation vector, from a solution of the Smoluchowski equation (SE) reduced to pair level. To account for the influence of the surrounding bath of particles on the interaction of a pair, an integro- differential form of the pair SE is developed; the integral portion represents the forces due to the bath which drive the pair interaction. Hydrodynamic interactions are accounted in a pairwise fashion, based on the dominant influence of pair lubrication interactions for concentrated suspensions. The SE is modified to include the influence of shear-induced relative diffusion, and this is found to be crucial for success of the theory; a simple model based on understanding of the shear-induced self-diffusivity is used for this property. The computation of the microstructure is split into two parts, one specific to near-equilibrium (Pe ≪ 1), where a regular perturbation expansion of g in Pe is applied, and a general
Pe solution of the full SE. The predicted microstructure at low Pe agrees with prior
theory for dilute conditions, and becomes increasingly distorted from the equilibrium isotropic state as φ increases at fixed P e < 1. Normal stress differences are predicted and the zero-shear viscosity predicted agrees with simulation results obtained using a Green- Kubo formulation (Foss, D. R. & Brady, J. F. 2000. J. Fluid Mech. 407, 167–200). At Pe > O(1), the influence of convection results in a progressively more anisotropic microstructure, with the contact values increasing with P e to yield a boundary layer and a wake. Agreement of the predicted microstructure with observations from simulations is generally good and discrepancies are clearly noted. The predicted rheology captures shear thinning and shear thickening as well as normal stress differences in good agreement with simulation; quantitative agreement is best at large φ.

  Rheological behavior of polypropylene (PP)/organoclay nanocomposites varying in compatibilizer (PP-g-MA)and organoclay concentration was investigated. The samples were prepared by melt intercalation method in an internal mixer. The wide angle X-ray diffraction patterns and results of rheological measurements showed that the compatibilizer had strong inﬂuence in increasing the interlayer spacing. The observed low frequency liquid-like to solid-like transition and apparent yield stress in simple shear ﬂows, along with convergence of transient shear stress to nonzero values in stress relaxation after the cessation of ﬂow experiments, were found to be consistent with formation of a physical network in quiescent conditions which could be easily ruptured with applying low shear rates. The values of stress overshoot strain in ﬂow reversal experiments were independent of shear rate, organoclay, and compatibilizer content. From the results of frequency sweep experiments in different nonlinear strain amplitudes it was shown that extended Cox-Merz analogy was valid in nonlinear dynamic deformations while the shear viscosity showed positive deviation from this analogy with higher deviations at lower shear rates. Results of storage modulus recovery and ﬂow reversal experiments at different shear rates suggested that network structure is reformed with a much slower rate compared to the rotational relaxation of organoclay platelets.
