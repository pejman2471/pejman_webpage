                 Mikhail Smirnov is an undergraduate student at New York Institute of Technology that is currently pursuing a BS in
                 Electrical and Computer Engineering and plans to pursue a minor in Mathematics. He began his college education in the
                 fall of 2018 and is expected to graduate in the spring of 2022. Due to his growing interest in math and physics, he
                 decided to delve deeper into the topics by pursuing research outside of classes. For this reason, he joined
                 Dr. Pejman Sanaei in December of 2019. Prior to that, he had some exposure to research from Dr. Sophia Domokos
                 in the fields of particle physics and string theory during the summer and fall of 2019, and he plans to continue
                 it in the future. His career goals include going to graduate school and later working in research and development,
                 whether it's in academia or industry. Outside of his academic interests, one of his biggest hobbies includes listening
                 to and writing music, and he plays various instruments, including drums, guitar, and piano

                 My name is Hamad El Kahza. I am pursuing a bachelor's degree at New York Tech, studying Electrical and Computer
                 Engineering with a healthy bit of balance from Computer Science; which transcends my predilection for Mathematics.
                 My previous research experiences include machine learning approach to large scale social media data analysis; which
                 determined the public’s opinion and sentiment polarity on a given topic, namely environmental policy over time and in
                 different places. For a while, my job experience was pointing me towards the direction of Electrical engineering/data
                 science. However, I am not interested in the quantitative aspect of data analysis, and I am not interested in engineering
                 purely for intellectual stimulation. Loosely speaking, I’m rather engrossed in the myriad complexity of their symbolic
                 relationship, a seamless combination of the two, their mathematical interconnection. Researching under the supervision
                 of Dr. Pejman Sanaei gave me the greatest opportunity to develop products as impactful as water filtration systems, and
                 bring meaningful change to developing societies. I was fortunate enough my response to random events led me to start
                 forging a less traditional path towards mathematics outreach.
