            Pleated membrane filters are widely used in many applications, and offer significantly
           better surface area to volume ratios than equal-area unpleated membrane filters.
           However, their filtration characteristics are markedly inferior to those of equivalent
           unpleated membrane filters in dead-end filtration. While several hypotheses have been
           advanced for this, one possibility is that the flow field induced by the pleating leads
           to spatially non-uniform fouling of the filter, which in turn degrades performance. In
           this work we investigate this hypothesis by developing a simplified model for the
           flow and fouling within a pleated membrane filter. Our model accounts for the pleated
           membrane geometry (which affects the flow), for porous support layers surrounding
           the membrane, and for two membrane fouling mechanisms: (i) adsorption of very
           small particles within membrane pores; and (ii) blocking of entire pores by large
           particles. We use asymptotic techniques based on the small pleat aspect ratio to solve
           the model, and we compare solutions to those for the closest-equivalent unpleated
           filter.

            Membrane filters are used extensively in microfiltration applications. The type of
                membrane used can vary widely depending on the particular application, but broadly
                speaking the requirements are to achieve fine control of separation, with low power
                consumption. The solution to this challenge might seem obvious: select the membrane
                with the largest pore size and void fraction consistent with the separation requirements.
                However, membrane fouling (an inevitable consequence of successful filtration) is a
                complicated process, which depends on many parameters other than membrane-pore
                size and void fraction; and which itself greatly affects the filtration process and
                membrane functionality. In this work we formulate mathematical models that can
                (i) account for the membrane internal morphology (internal structure, pore size
                and shape, etc.); (ii) describe fouling of membranes with specific morphology; and
                (iii) make some predictions as to what type of membrane morphology might offer
                optimum filtration performance.

                Membrane filters are in widespread industrial use, and mathematical models to predict
                their efficacy are potentially very useful, as such models can suggest design modifications
                to improve filter performance and lifetime. Many models have been proposed to describe
                particle capture by membrane filters and the associated fluid dynamics, but most such
                models are based on a very simple structure in which the pores of the membrane are
                assumed to be simple circularly cylindrical tubes spanning the depth of the membrane.
                Real membranes used in applications usually have much more complex geometry, with
                interconnected pores that may branch and bifurcate. Pores are also typically larger on the
                upstream side of the membrane than on the downstream side. We present an idealized
                mathematical model, in which a membrane consists of a series of bifurcating pores,
                which decrease in size as the membrane is traversed. Feed solution is forced through
                the membrane by applied pressure and particles are removed from the feed by adsorption
                within pores (which shrinks them). Thus, the membraneâ€™s permeability decreases as the
                filtration progresses. We discuss how filtration efficiency depends on the characteristics of
                the idealized branching structure.

                 Manufacturers of membrane filters have an interest in optimizing the internal pore structure of the membrane to achieve
                 the most efficient filtration. As filtration occurs, the membrane becomes fouled by impurities in the feed solution, and
                 any model of filter performance must account for this. In this work, we present a simplified mathematical model, which
                 (i) characterizes membrane internal pore structure via permeability or resistance gradients in the depth of the membrane;
                 (ii) accounts for multiple simultaneous membrane fouling mechanisms (adsorption, blocking and cake formation); (iii)
                 defines a measure of filter performance; and (iv) for given operating conditions, is able to predict the optimum
                 permeability or resistance profile for the chosen performance measure.

                 We study the influence of a membrane filter's internal pore structure on its flow and adsorptive fouling behaviour.
                 Membrane performance is measured via 1) comparison of flux-throughput characteristics during filtration; and 2) control
                 of concentration of foulants at membrane pore outlets. Taking both measures into account, we address the merits and
                 drawbacks of selected membrane pore structures. We first model layered planar membrane structures with intra-layer pore
                 connections, and present comparisons between non-connected and connected structures. Our model predicts that membrane
                 filters with connected pore structures lead to higher total throughput than those with non-connected structures, over
                 the filter lifetime. We also provide a sufficient criterion for the concentration of particles escaping the filter to
                 achieve a maximum in time (indicative of a membrane filter whose particle retention capability can deteriorate).
                 Additionally, we find that spatial inhomogeneity in the pore-size distribution influences performance of filters
                 differently when their pores have different connectivity properties.

                 Pleated membrane filters, which offer larger surface area to volume ratios than unpleated membrane filters, are used in
                 a wide variety of applications. However, the performance of the pleated filter, as characterized by a flux-throughput
                 plot, indicates that the equivalent unpleated filter provides better performance under the same pressure drop. Earlier
                 work (Sanaei~\& Cummings 2016) used a highly-simplified membrane model to investigate how the pleating effect and
                 membrane geometry affect this performance differential. In this work, we extend this line of investigation and use
                 asymptotic methods to couple an outer problem for the flow within the pleated structure to an inner problem that accounts
                 for the pore structure within the membrane. We use our new model to formulate and address questions of optimal membrane

                 Multilayered membrane filters, which consist of a stack of thin porous membranes with different properties (such as pore
                 size and void fraction), are widely used in industrial applications to remove contaminants and undesired impurities
                 (particles) from a solvent. It has been observed experimentally that the performance of well-designed multilayer
                 structured membranes is markedly better than that of equivalent homogeneous membranes. Mathematical characterization and
                 modeling of multilayered membranes can help our understanding of how the properties of each layer affect the performance
                 of the overall membrane stack. In this paper, we present a simplified mathematical model to describe how the pore-scale

                 Membrane science is a known area of study, which motivates the development and improvement of filtration technology in
                 various industries. Membrane filters structures are equipped with specific properties, such as pore size and void
                 fraction, which both vary depending on different applications. The requirement of filtration is to achieve the separation
                 of particles and fluid, while minimizing the energy consumption at the same time. However, membrane fouling is inevitable
                 during the filtration process and affects membrane functionality in any filtration stage. Membrane fouling is a very
                 complex process and is determined by many properties such as the membrane internal morphology, internal membrane pore
                 structure, flow rate and contaminant properties. In a very slow filtration process or during the late stage of filtration,
                 when the flow rate is naturally low and P\'eclet number is small, particle diffusion is essential and can not be
                 neglected, while in typical filtration models, especially in moderate and fast filtration process, it is completely
                 ignored. The objective of this study is to investigate how filtration process changes under possible effects brought by
                 particle diffusion. We discuss how membrane morphology evolves and investigate the filtration performance during the
                 filtration process. We also compare the results with the situation where diffusion is less important (in a fast
                 filtration process) and make a prediction about what kind of membrane filter should be employed to achieve a particular
                 optimum filtration performance in a slow process.
