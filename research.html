       <h4><strong> Flow and Fouling in a Pleated Membrane Filter</strong></h4>

       <li>Pleated membrane filters are widely used in many applications, and offer significantly
           better surface area to volume ratios than equal-area unpleated membrane filters.
           However, their filtration characteristics are markedly inferior to those of equivalent
           unpleated membrane filters in dead-end filtration. While several hypotheses have been
           advanced for this, one possibility is that the flow field induced by the pleating leads
           to spatially non-uniform fouling of the filter, which in turn degrades performance. In
           this work we investigate this hypothesis by developing a simplified model for the
           flow and fouling within a pleated membrane filter. Our model accounts for the pleated
           membrane geometry (which affects the flow), for porous support layers surrounding
           the membrane, and for two membrane fouling mechanisms: (i) adsorption of very
           small particles within membrane pores; and (ii) blocking of entire pores by large
           particles. We use asymptotic techniques based on the small pleat aspect ratio to solve
           the model, and we compare solutions to those for the closest-equivalent unpleated
           filter.</li></figure>

       <h4><strong> Flow and Fouling in Membrane Filters: Effects of Membrane Morphology</strong></h4>

            <li>Membrane filters are used extensively in microfiltration applications. The type of
                membrane used can vary widely depending on the particular application, but broadly
                speaking the requirements are to achieve fine control of separation, with low power
                consumption. The solution to this challenge might seem obvious: select the membrane
                with the largest pore size and void fraction consistent with the separation requirements.
                However, membrane fouling (an inevitable consequence of successful filtration) is a
                complicated process, which depends on many parameters other than membrane-pore
                size and void fraction; and which itself greatly affects the filtration process and
                membrane functionality. In this work we formulate mathematical models that can
                (i) account for the membrane internal morphology (internal structure, pore size
                and shape, etc.); (ii) describe fouling of membranes with specific morphology; and
                (iii) make some predictions as to what type of membrane morphology might offer
                optimum filtration performance.</li></figure>

        <!--The mitotic spindle apparatus is the cellular structure that divides chromosomes in cell division.
        The asymmetric vs symmetric cell division and the high fidelity of the process is largely 
        determined by the position and alignment of the mitotic spindle with respect to the 
        anterior-posterior axis of the cell. Different force transduction mechanisms 
        are thought to be involved in this process. 
        I use biophysical models related to these mechanisms as inputs to our dynamic simulations to probe the 
        positioning of mitotic spindle and the resulting generated cytoplasmic flows. To this end, we work closely with experimentalist namely <a href="http://www.needleman.seas.harvard.edu"> Dan Needleman's Lab</a>.
        Our simulation results show that 
        the time scale of positioning critically depends on hydrodynamic interactions of the astral microtubules 
        with each other and the cortex. Moreover we demonstrate that each mechanism leaves behind its distinct fingerprint 
        on the cytoplasmic flows. These flow signatures can be used to differentiate between the mechanisms.

        <li>Manufacturers of membrane filters have an interest in optimizing the internal pore structure of the membrane to achieve the most efficient filtration. As filtration occurs, the membrane becomes fouled by impurities in the feed solution, and any model of filter performance must account for this. In this work, we present a simplified mathematical model, which (i) characterizes membrane internal pore structure via permeability or resistance gradients in the depth of the membrane; (ii) accounts for multiple simultaneous membrane fouling mechanisms (adsorption, blocking and cake formation); (iii) defines a measure of filter performance; and (iv) for given operating conditions, is able to predict the optimum permeability or resistance profile for the chosen performance measure.</li>
            <!--A reasonable question that membrane filter manufacturers may ask is: what is the optimal configuration of filter membranes, in terms of internal morphology (pore size and shape), to achieve the most efficient filtration? In order to answer this question, we must first propose a robust measure of filtration performance. Filter membrane performance can be measured in a number of different ways. As filtration occurs the membrane becomes blocked, or fouled, by the impurities in the feed solution, and any performance measure must take account of this. For example, one performance measure might be the total throughput - the amount of filtered feed solution - at the end of filtration process, when the membrane is so badly blocked that it is deemed no longer functional. We investigate a simplified mathematical model, which (i) characterizes membrane internal pore structure via pore or permeability profiles in the depth of the membrane; (ii) accounts for various membrane fouling mechanisms (adsorption, blocking and cake formation); and (iii) defines a measure of filter performance; and (iv) predicts the optimum pore or permeability profile for our chosen performance measure.-->

The mechanics of mitotic spindle in C-elegans is studied by using the data from a 3D reconstruction of spindle structure with electron tomography. In short, our aim to use theory and dynamic simulation to uncover the mechanics of microtubules (MTs), most notably kinetochore MTs, during metaphase and anaphase periods of cell division. These findings may significantly help us in underpinning the physical principles that determine the dynamics of formation and rearrangement of the mitotic spindle.>-->
        <h2><strong> Membrane filtration with Complex Branching Pore Morphology </strong></h2>
        <figure class="centered"><img src="images/branch.png" width="300" height="230" class="centered"/>
<span style ="line-height:100%">
            
            <p>
            <li>Membrane filters are in widespread industrial use, and mathematical models to predict
                their efficacy are potentially very useful, as such models can suggest design modifications
                to improve filter performance and lifetime. Many models have been proposed to describe
                particle capture by membrane filters and the associated fluid dynamics, but most such
                models are based on a very simple structure in which the pores of the membrane are
                assumed to be simple circularly cylindrical tubes spanning the depth of the membrane.
                Real membranes used in applications usually have much more complex geometry, with
                interconnected pores that may branch and bifurcate. Pores are also typically larger on the
                upstream side of the membrane than on the downstream side. We present an idealized
                mathematical model, in which a membrane consists of a series of bifurcating pores,
                which decrease in size as the membrane is traversed. Feed solution is forced through
                the membrane by applied pressure and particles are removed from the feed by adsorption
                within pores (which shrinks them). Thus, the membrane’s permeability decreases as the
                filtration progresses. We discuss how filtration efficiency depends on the characteristics of
                the idealized branching structure.</li></figure>

    <li>Cell proliferation within a fluid-filled porous tissue-engineering scaffold depends on a sensitive choice of pore geometry and flow rates: regions of high curvature encourage cell proliferation, while a critical flow rate is required to promote growth for certain cell types. When the flow rate is too slow the nutrient supply is limited; too fast and cells may be damaged by the high fluid shear stress. As a result, determining appropriate tissue-engineering-construct geometries and operating regimes poses a significant challenge that cannot be addressed by experimentation alone. In this work, we present a mathematical theory for the fluid flow within a pore of a tissue-engineering scaffold, which is coupled to the growth of cells on the pore walls. We exploit the slenderness of a pore that is typical in such a scenario, to derive a reduced model that enables a comprehensive analysis of the system to be performed. We derive analytical solutions in a particular case of a nearly piecewise constant growth law and compare these with numerical solutions of the reduced model. Qualitative comparisons of tissue morphologies predicted by our model, with those observed experimentally, are also made. We demonstrate how the simplified system may be used to make predictions on the design of a tissue-engineering scaffold and the appropriate operating regime that ensures a desired level of tissue growth.</li></figure>

          <li>Membrane filters have been widely used in industrial applications to remove contaminants and undesired impurities from the solvent. During the filtration process the membrane internal void area becomes fouled with impurities and as a consequence the filter performance deteriorates, which indeed depends on filter internal structure, particles concentration and flow. The complexity of membrane internal morphology and stochasticity of particles flow make the filtration process and fouling mechanisms a mysterious phenomenon and hard to study. Therefore, mathematical modeling can play a key role in investigating filter fouling and discovering efficient filtration process. So far various mathematical models have been proposed to describe the complexity of membrane structure and stochasticity of particles flow individually but very few focus on both together. In this work, we present an idealized mathematical model, in which a membrane consists of a series of bifurcating pores, which decrease in size as the membrane is traversed and particles are removed from the feed by adsorption within pores (which shrinks them) and stochastic sieving (blocking by large particles). We discuss how filtration efficiency depends on the characteristics of the branching structure.</li></figure>

      <li>Multi-layer membrane filters, which consist of several thin porous membranes with different properties (such as pore size and void fraction) stacked on top of each other, are widely used in industrial applications to remove contaminants and undesired impurities (particles) from a solvent. It has been experimentally observed that the performance of well-designed multilayer structured membranes are markedly better than those of equivalent homogeneous membranes. Mathematical characterization and modeling of multi-layer membranes can help our understanding of how the properties of each layer affect the performance of the overall membrane stack. In this work, we present a simplified mathematical model to describe how the microscopic properties of a multi-layer membrane affect the overall filter performance.</li></figure>

              <li>The removal of pollutants such as sulfur dioxide from industrial exhaust
              before release into the atmosphere is of considerable environmental interest. One means
              of removing sulfur dioxide is through a chemical reaction with water vapor in a porous filter
              composed of specially-designed solid particles or fibers. A product of this reaction is
              sulfuric acid which forms in the pore space of the filter. We discuss a mathematical
              description of this chemical reaction and develop models for transport of sulfur dioxide in a
              porous filter and for the accompanying fluid production. Our goal is to improve the
              understanding of how transport and reaction processes occur and how the generation
              of fluid impacts the effectiveness of the filter. Flooding, which occurs when fluid in
              the pore space makes its way to the exterior of the filter, is of particular interest.
              Mathematical and computational models developed here may aid in understanding the
              underlying transport and reaction mechanisms and in improving filter efficiency.</li></figure>-->

<h4><strong> Meteorites with Stable Descending Orientation</strong></h4>

        <li>The atmospheric erosion of meteors is a splendid example of the reshaping of a solid object due to its motion through a fluid. Motivated by meteorite samples collected on Earth that suggest fixed orienta- tion during flight–most notably the strikingly conical shape of so-called oriented meteorites–here the hypothesis that such forms result from an aerodynamic stabilization of posture that may be achieved only by specific shapes, is explored. The laboratory scale experiment is conducted for exploring systematic static stability tests on cones of varying apex angles in fast flows, and the resulting map of the orientational equilibria and their stability shows how oriented flight emerges through blue-sky and pitchfork bifurcations. A 2D mathematical model has been developed, and is being compared with the experimental results. Armed with the simplified 2D model of oriented meteorites (with a conical shape), an isosceles triangle is considered in order to calculate its flow wake structure using free streamline theory. Preliminary comparisons with
            experiment appear very promising.

                    Layered planar membrane structures with intra-layer pore connections are modelled.
                    Comparisons between non-connected and connected models are presented. Additionally, the influence of spatial, pore-size inhomogeneity on overall performance is modeled
                    by adding noise perturbation to the pore-size distribution of homogeneous membrane
                    structures. Membrane performance is gauged via i) the relative comparison of total
                    throughput and flux evolution during filtration; and ii) control of concentration of
                    foulants at membrane pore outlets.</li></figure>

           <li>Directional decision-making during cell migration is important for regenerative medicine (tissue engineering, wound healing) and developmental biology, since tissue development depends on how the cells distribute themselves within the complex pores of the extra-cellular matrix (ECM). However, current single cell studies are not representative of the scenarios in which multiple cells enter the pores simultaneously and affect each other’s decisions. At the same time,“collective” migration investigations mainly focus on cells that form stable adhesions with other cells during movement (e.g. epithelial cells). Yet, fibroblasts, which are more relevant to synthesizing collagen and ECM, tend to migrate as individual cells when squeezing through the microscopic tissue pores. Previous studies on social interactions in fibroblast migration mainly focused on random migration, while chemotaxis appears to be much less-studied. In order to address the lack of knowledge in this area, a collaboration was initiated with Prof. R. Voronov’s group in Chemical, Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering department at NJIT, to derive mathematical models to describe their experimental lab work. This experimental lab work is investigating two unexplored aspects of fibroblast migration that are particularly relevant to proliferative environments commonly encountered in regenerative medicine: effects of cell sequence and mitosis on chemotaxis in micro-sized pores.
