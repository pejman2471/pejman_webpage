                        the<a href="https://www.cims.nyu.edu"> Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a> (CIMS),
                        <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/"> New York University</a> (NYU) and working on mathematical modeling and simulation

                            Research and Training Group in Mathematical Modeling and Simulation</a> at CIMS. I finished my Ph.D
                        (August 2017), in applied mathematics from the <a href="https://math.njit.edu/"> Department of Mathematical
                        Sciences</a> (DMS) at <a href="http://www.njit.edu/"> New Jersey Institute of Technology</a> (NJIT) at

                        academic advisor <a href="https://math.njit.edu/faculty/lcumming"> Professor Linda Cummings</a>. I have an
                        undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering (fluid mechanics) and a masters degree in pure mathematics, both
                        completed before I began my Ph.D. studies at NJIT. During my Ph.D. studies I also completed a masters degree in
                        applied statistics, awarded in December 2016. I have expertise in fluid mechanics, deterministic and stochastic
                        approaches to mathematical modeling, tissue engineering, applications of mathematics to industry and in particular
                        my dissertation topic is mathematical modeling of membrane filtration.

                        <!--This topic arose from work carried out on a problem presented by Pall Corporation at the 2013 Mathematical Problems in Industry (MPI 2013) Workshop: (these workshops are week-long events at which academic participants from industry present problems, on which academic participants work in groups). The following year at MPI 2014 another problem was proposed by the same company, asking us to investigate the effect of membrane morphology on the flow and fouling characteristics of membrane filters. In recognition of my outstanding contributions at MPI 2014 I was elected as recipient of the 2014 MPI Graduate Fellowship (under NSF Grant DMS-1261596) and presented my work in a special lecture at the 2015 MPI Workshop. The collaboration with Pall Corporation is ongoing, and has so far led to couple of journal papers, which appeared in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics.<p>
                        
                        In addition, I have worked on some side projects beside my dissertation. As a continuation of a PhD course work in dynamical systems, I worked on “Dynamics of vortex dipoles in anisotropic Bose–Einstein condensate”. I am also newly involved in a tissue engineering project with our collaborators from the University of Oxford. In this project we are trying to model the mechanisms of tissue growth on the pore-scale within a nutrient-perfused scaffold, where growth is a function of underlying pore curvature, fluid dynamical shear stress, and local nutrient concentration. Work is underway to match our model predictions to experimental data.-->

                                <!--    I am a postdoctoral fellow at Courant Institute of NYU.
                                My interest broadly concerns the behavior of complex fluids and soft materials
                                in natural and synthetic settings. 
                                The term, "complex fluids" generically applies to 
                                fluids that  are driven out of their equilibrium state 
                                by means of internally generated or externally imposed
                                forces. The complex and fascination behavior of these systems 
                                arises as a consequence of the coupling 
                                between their microstructure and macroscopic behavior. 
                                Some examples of complex fluids include suspensions, macromolecular assemblies, biological fluids, 
                                 and active materials.
                                 I am particularly interested in the relationship between microscale interactions, 
                                microstructure, and collective dynamics of complex fluids.
                                Finding these relationshps can potentially provide the blueprint for design 
                                and control of novel materials in microscopic scales.
                                I use a combination of 
                                coarse-grained theories based on non-equilibrium statatistical mechanics 
                                and microhydrodynamics and direct dynamic simulations
                                to study the the dynamics of these many-body systems 
                                in wide range of time and length scales. </span> </p>
                              <p>
                              I did my doctoral studies in the department of Chemical Engineering and Levich Institute of
                              City College of New York where I worked with Jeff Morris as my supervisor. My Ph.D. research involved developing first-principles theories for predicting structure and rheology of colloidal suspensions far from equilibrium. The developed theory is based on  Smoluchowski probability distribution function. I also used Stokesian Dynamics numerical simulations to guid and test the theory.>-->

                                     <p>A single ride on a cable car costs $6. If you plan to travel around the city, it’s often cheaper to buy a Muni Passport, which gives you unlimited rides on San Francisco’s extensive public transport system, including the cable cars (but not the BART subway system). Even a single-day passport ($14) will save you money if you make a return trip, and stop off to visit Chinatown one way.</p>
                                     <p>There are often long lines at the cable car terminus, particularly on the Powell-Mason and Powell-Hyde routes. If you don’t want to wait, try walking a few stops along the route. The conductor usually leaves a small number of places to pick up passengers on the way. The California Street route is generally less crowded (but not as spectacular).</p>
